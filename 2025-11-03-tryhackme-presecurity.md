 ## What I Learned (DAY 2)
 - IP Address(internet Protocol) are unique identifier assign to a device or domain that connents t the internet
 - There are two type of IP Address which are: IPV4(Internet protocol version 4) and IPV6(Internet protocol version 6)
 - Example of IPV4 are IP Address divided into 4 octets and number ranges from 0 to 255 example are this 10.139.210.098
 - Example of IPV6 Address are long sequence of number and alphabet usually 8 octets example are 1a23.r4w5.55h7.90gf.5hy8.k0u9.0so6.22va
 - DNS(Domain Name System) is what convert human-friendly domain names to IP address that computer use
 - HTTP(Hypertext transfer protocol) is the protocol for transferring web pages. HTTPS adds encryption for security
 - firewall controls and filters incoming/outgoing network traffic to protect system
 - there are either public or private IP

 # Day 3 - Learning Linux Commands & Explore TryHackMe "Linus Fundamentals" rooms(Parts 1-3)
