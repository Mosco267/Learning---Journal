 # Day 2 - Basic Computer & Network Terms
 **Date:** 2025-11-04
 **Platform:** Cloudflare & TryHackMe - Module:Network Fundamentals

 ## What I Learned (DAY 2)
 - IP Address(internet Protocol) are unique identifier assign to a device or domain that connents t the internet
 - There are two type of IP Address which are: IPV4(Internet protocol version 4) and IPV6(Internet protocol version 6)
 - Example of IPV4 are IP Address divided into 4 octets and number ranges from 0 to 255 example are this 10.139.210.098
 - Example of IPV6 Address are long sequence of number and alphabet usually 8 octets example are 1a23.r4w5.55h7.90gf.5hy8.k0u9.0so6.22va
 - DNS(Domain Name System) is what convert human-friendly domain names to IP address that computer use
 - HTTP(Hypertext transfer protocol) is the protocol for transferring web pages. HTTPS adds encryption for security
 - firewall controls and filters incoming/outgoing network traffic to protect system
 - there are either public or private IP

 # Day 4 - Learning Networking and How The Internet Works

 ## What I Learned (DAY 4)
 - TCP/IP(Trasmission control protocol)/(Internet protocol)
 - ARP(Address resolution protocol)
 - DNS(Domain name system)
 - ISP(Internet service provider)
 - DHCP(Dynamic host configuration protocol)
 - NAT(Network address translation)
 - LAN(Local area network) example your home router
